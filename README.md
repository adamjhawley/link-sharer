# Link-Sharer

The Link-Sharer is a domain-agnostic link sharing website.

## Aims

This project aims to create a working link sharing website. Once the initial site is working, the
plan is to focus on adapting it so that users can easily host their own version.

## Status

This project is at an extremely early stage and developed by a single developer at the time of
writing. The current aim is to reach MVP status.

So far the website includes:
- A sign-up/sign-in page for creating and using accounts on the site
- A submission page for users to submit links
- A browse page for users to browse links submitted by
other users

This is supported by Firebase integration for basic authentication and storage.
